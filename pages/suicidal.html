	<p>Sometimes life can feel so bad that you don’t want it to go on any more.</p>
	<p>Suicidal people don’t necessarily want their life to end – they just want their emotional or physical
		pain to end.</p>
	<p>Suicidal thoughts sometimes start because people feel overwhelmed by their problems or their situation. When we get overwhelmed we can find it hard to see a way out. Our thinking can become very negatively
		focussed and narrowed down and it becomes difficult to get perspective and find solutions.</p>
	<p>Suicidal thoughts are far more common than people realise – we just don’t talk about them – we suffer in
		silence.</p>
	<p>Absolutely anyone might have thoughts of suicide.</p>
	<p>People can become suicidal if they have really difficult or upsetting things to deal with or if they have lots of
		smaller worries that combine to make them feel overwhelmed.</p>
	<p>Telling someone how you feel can be embarrassing or frightening. But talking to someone is the first step to
		getting help, staying safe and developing a sense of hope.</p>
